## [XLA(Accelerated Linear Algebra)](https://openxla.org/xla) ##
XLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra) is an open-source compiler for machine learning. The XLA compiler takes models from popular frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX, and optimizes the models for high-performance execution across different hardware platforms including GPUs, CPUs, and ML accelerators.

As a part of the OpenXLA project, XLA is built collaboratively by industry-leading ML hardware and software companies, including Alibaba, Amazon Web Services, AMD, Apple, Arm, Google, Intel, Meta, and NVIDIA.
